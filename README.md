# CTFs and Wargames

This is a repository where I will be safely storing my progress in various
CTFs and Wargames. I decided to make this repo after losing my CTF/Wargames
data... twice.

NOTE: In flags.md files, any text in italics is help that I got from writeups.
Everything else is stuff that I figured out myself. In some puzzles, I got
stuck but on the right path, and in such cases, you'll usually see some parts
in regular text and some parts in italics text within the same sentence.

Could not include most of the files for Cisco SecCon and Amrita InCTF 2019 as
some files (e.g. in forensics) were too large for GitHub.
